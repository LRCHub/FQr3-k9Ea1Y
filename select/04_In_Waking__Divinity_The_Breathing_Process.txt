Scarlet, nights whisper cold as frost
Fire, consuming hell.
Power, embracing death.
Harlot, seducing sin.

Passion for myself I will
Fight you until the end.

Now her heart bleeds.
Her heart bleeds destruction.
Cry louder...

"This is power!"

Her power...

Scarlet, nights whisper cold as frost
Fire, consuming hell.
Power, embracing death.
Harlot, seducing sin.

Death is in our blood.
We are one in death...
Death my sinner for thine blood will flow.
Until the end our ghosts wait to be.

Her words haunting me...

"I am the fire that fuels the carnage...
I am the plague that consumes the planet...
I am disease. The death incarnate."

I am desperate cold and hollow...
I am disease: the death incarnate.

Death is in our blood. We are one in death.
Death my sinner for thine blood will flow.
Until the end our ghosts wait to be.
One in deaths embrace.

Our light shines through as deaths dark cold embrace.
Through deaths dark embrace.
Our light will cleanse.
We are God.

In death we are one, we are God.

Scarlet, nights whisper cold as frost
Fire, consuming hell.
Power, embracing death.
Harlot, seducing sin.
